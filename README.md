# The Death Gap: Theory Map & Reflection

### Analyzing David Ansell’s *The Death Gap* through the Neo-Marxist Framework of Muntaner et al.

---

## Purpose

This project visually and conceptually connects **Muntaner et al.’s Neo-Marxist theory of class and health inequality** to **David Ansell’s field analysis** in *The Death Gap: How Inequality Kills*. It explores how economic exploitation, racial segregation, and structural domination create predictable health disparities across Chicago’s neighborhoods.

* **Course Context:** Sociology of Health and Illness
* **Primary Texts:**

  * David A. Ansell, *The Death Gap: How Inequality Kills* (University of Chicago Press, 2017)
  * Muntaner et al., *Two Decades of Neo-Marxist Class Analysis and Health Inequalities: A Critical Reconstruction* (Social Theory & Health, 2015)

> ### Core Claim
>
> Health inequality is not random, it is produced by class exploitation and maintained through systems of racialized and legal exclusion.

## Content Overview

The site is structured around four interactive sections that guide users from theory to critical reconstruction:

* **Theory Map:** Outlines the Neo-Marxist class framework (Muntaner et al.) and maps it onto mechanisms of exploitation and domination evident in *The Death Gap*.
* **What It Explains:** Shows how Muntaner’s theory clarifies the structural roots of inequality, specifically, how the well-being of the wealthy depends on the deprivation of the poor.
* **What It Can’t Explain:** Identifies the framework’s limits, especially its underemphasis on race, immigration status, and other intersecting systems of hierarchy.
* **Reconstructing Theory:** Proposes an expanded model integrating racial capitalism and intersectionality to explain how class, race, and legal status jointly produce “structural violence.”

## Key Concepts

### 1. Exploitation as the Cause of Inequality

Health disparities arise from exploitative economic relations where the welfare of one class depends on the deprivation of another, what Muntaner calls the **inverse interdependent welfare principle**.

### 2. Domination and Social Control

Systems like **mass incarceration**, **segregated healthcare**, and **employment-based insurance** are mechanisms that enforce class domination and restrict access to life-sustaining resources.

### 3. The Importance of Race and Other Hierarchies

While class exploitation is central, **race** functions as a distinct and interlocking structure of inequality. Ansell shows that even when income is equal, Black Americans experience higher mortality, revealing racialized mechanisms beyond class alone.

### 4. Reconstructing Theory

A more complete model integrates **racial capitalism** and **intersectionality**, treating class exploitation and racialization as **mutually constitutive** forces. This lens explains how exploitation extends beyond the workplace to include:

* The extraction of wealth through redlining and predatory lending
* The hyper-exploitation of labor through incarceration
* The exclusion from healthcare based on race or immigration status

## How to Use It

1. Start with the **Theory Map** tab to understand Muntaner’s Neo-Marxist model.
2. Move through **What It Explains** and **What It Can’t Explain** to evaluate the framework’s scope and limits.
3. End at **Reconstructing Theory**, which synthesizes insights from racial capitalism and intersectionality to form a more complete model of “structural violence.”
4. Use the visual flow to trace how class relations, racial hierarchies, and legal exclusions converge to produce the *death gap*.

## Design & Accessibility

### Design

* **Glassmorphism Interface:** Semi-transparent “glass” elements over a dark photographic background evoke visibility and opacity, key metaphors for structural violence.
* **Tabbed Navigation:** Separates complex ideas into clear, digestible sections.
* **Responsive Layout:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile displays.

### Accessibility

* **Readable Typography (Inter Font Family)**
* **High Contrast and Reduced Motion for Accessibility Preferences**
* **Semantic HTML for Screen Readers**
