# The Death Gap: Theory Map and Reflection

### A research-based visual model linking structural violence to health inequality in Chicago, based on the work of David Ansell and Paul Farmer.

**Live Site:** [http://aronagaye.me/DEATHGAP/](http://aronagaye.me/DEATHGAP/)

-----

##  Purpose

This project presents a visual model that connects **Paul Farmer’s theory of structural violence** with **David Ansell’s fieldwork** in *The Death Gap*. It supports a sociological analysis of how inequality creates predictable, fatal health outcomes across Chicago's neighborhoods.

  - **Course Context:** Sociology of Health and Illness
  - **Primary Text:** David A. Ansell, *The Death Gap: How Inequality Kills*. University of Chicago Press, 2017.

> ### Core Claim
>
> Health inequality follows social structure. Policy, race, and geography are powerful predictors of disease and life expectancy.

##  Content Overview

The site is organized into four main tabs, each serving a distinct analytical function:

  * **Theory Map:** Models structural violence from its root causes (e.g., racism, policy) to its ultimate outcome (the death gap).
  * **What It Explains:** Links the abstract theory to observed data and predictable health disparities.
  * **What It Obscures:** Highlights the limitations of a purely structural model by acknowledging community agency and resilience.
  * **Reconstructing Theory:** Proposes an enhanced model that integrates the concept of collective efficacy as a mitigating factor.

-----

##  How to Use It

1.  **Begin at the Theory Map tab.**
2.  Follow the logical flow from macro-level **structural causes** down to micro-level **health outcomes**.
3.  Note each **mechanism** (e.g., disinvestment, segregation) and its cited evidence.
4.  Use the framework to analyze a local or comparative case study of health inequality.

##  Key Mechanisms Driving the Gap

The model identifies four interconnected mechanisms of structural violence:

  * **Economic Exploitation & Disinvestment:** The historical and ongoing impact of redlining, contract selling, and industry flight.
  * **Racial Segregation & Concentrated Disadvantage:** The role of hypersegregation in reducing collective efficacy and concentrating poverty.
  * **Social & Environmental Determinants:** The creation of food deserts and the disproportionate exposure of minority communities to environmental toxins.
  * **Separate & Unequal Systems:** The legacy of segregated hospitals and the persistent denial of adequate care based on race and geography.

-----

##  What the Model Explains

  * Predictable and severe health disparities between different neighborhoods.
  * The **embodied effects** of chronic stress, poverty, and discrimination on human biology.
  * The clear and persistent pattern linking a person's **place of residence to their life expectancy**.

> ### Action Framework
>
> The project follows a three-part framework for social justice:
>
> 1.  **Observe:** Document and visualize suffering with concrete data.
> 2.  **Judge:** Identify the upstream structural causes of that suffering.
> 3.  **Act:** Engage in pragmatic solidarity and advocate for systemic reform.

##  Design & Accessibility

### Design

The site was built with a focus on clarity and user experience.

  * **Tabbed Interface:** Separates distinct analytical sections for easy navigation.
  * **Responsive Layout:** Ensures usability across devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
  * **Glassmorphism Style:** Uses a modern, high-contrast aesthetic for visual appeal and readability.

### Accessibility

  * **Readable Typography:** Uses clear, legible fonts and adequate sizing.
  * **High Color Contrast:** Designed to be accessible for users with low vision.
  * **Reduced Motion:** Keeps animations minimal to accommodate users who prefer a static experience.
